How to Contribute
=================

First of all, thanks for reading this! I am really tired of working on this
project alone.

Writing code
------------

Please try to follow the Linux kernel coding style which is available at
https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.10/process/coding-style.html.

A general guideline is to try to keep the code clean and consistent.

Please read the emulator's code before trying to contribute to it.

Submitting code
---------------

You can either fork the GitHub repository (https://github.com/zuh0/boi) and
then open a pull request or send patches by mail to gabriel.duque@lse.epita.fr.
